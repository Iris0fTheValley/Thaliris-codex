# Thaliris Controller instructions

Canonical package resource: `src/thaliris_codex/controller_instructions.md`.
The installed pinned runner returns a procedure index with `controller-instructions`
and one selected procedure with `controller-instructions --section <name>`.
Normal Controller guidance is resident in the normal bootstrap response/context:
startup, authority, routing, handoff, Workstream endpoints, durable selection,
waiting/completion and causal diagnosis. Retrieve task-recovery or host-maintenance
only when their exceptional operation is needed. Measure the complete normal task
context plus retrieval cost and quality, not the shortest individual prompt. The
required startup operation delivers it once; shared inherited instructions do not
inject the full Controller routine into every fresh child. Missing context can
retrieve an exact section.
Repository docs are rendered from this resource. Assigned children follow their selected handoff and role; they
may retrieve other rules on demand within their authority. Retrieval grants no authority.

## Startup and admission

For substantive file-changing project work, including README-only changes,
configuration changes and new project creation, unless the human opts out, the owning
Controller runs `<installed pinned runner> --root <repo> codex-bootstrap` directly once. Chatting
and read-only work needs no project bootstrap. When a new project directory has no Git
metadata, initialize Git at the intended project root before bootstrap if creating a
repository is within the user's requested project scope; do not initialize unrelated
directories or create Git metadata for read-only work. Bootstrap itself still requires
Git metadata and never initializes arbitrary directories.
Managed children follow their handoff; do not bootstrap, task-start or task-abandon
the owning Controller's ACTIVE task. Use this installed pinned runner for later operations;
do not select alternate startup commands, shell-computed hashes or unknown runtime code.
On READY (or legacy DEFINITION_READY_ACTOR_UNKNOWN), create a separate UTF-8 JSON authority
contract file selecting the actual human instruction, boundary, invariants,
acceptance and, when the human chooses, execution_mode: delegated, controller-direct
or single-agent. Omitted mode defaults to delegated; an explicit human choice wins.
Non-mode fields are nonempty strings. Then in a separate standalone direct tool call
run `<installed pinned runner> --root '<repo>' --session-id '<current-native-session-id>' task-start '<goal>' --authority-contract '<absolute-file-path>'`, using the quoted absolute file path.
The contract argument is a file path, never inline JSON; do not combine invocations.
Explicit contract admission needs no bootstrap receipt or single-use Hook bearer.
Legacy receipt/proof arguments remain compatibility inputs, not human authentication.
After admission follow the effective project router and selected execution mode.
Retain the returned Task ID. Later task operations select it with global
`--task-id <id>` or the explicitly associated current session. A workspace's old
ACTIVE state, UNKNOWN child or orphaned reservation never selects the current task.
New tasks have separate ledgers and authority; old evidence remains recoverable.
Legacy singleton state is available only for intentional diagnostics or explicit
same-task recovery, and grants no automatic session association.

## Persistent authority

Native `/root` and `primary agent` describe native tree/execution position.
Thaliris Controller names task responsibility for goal, boundary, selected context,
routing, evidence and final acceptance. The same actor may hold both positions;
neither native position nor task responsibility proves admission or Host identity.
The owning Controller is the Thaliris task owner. Parent means the immediate
delegator; a Scanner's parent may be an Implementer, Focused Implementer or Reviewer.
Thaliris Task ID selects the admitted task and is distinct from native Thread,
Session and Agent IDs; use their explicit associations rather than substituting IDs.
Thaliris `execution_mode` selects delegated, controller-direct or single-agent task
execution independently of native `multi_agent_mode` and `collaboration_mode`.
Native mode or tree position never selects or changes the task's authority contract.

Authority is persistent Controller-asserted human intent under governance, not
mechanical human/Root authentication. Host Root identity remains UNKNOWN.
UserPromptSubmit, missing fields, matching session, PID, environment and SessionSource
mint no authority. Known child, readonly, abandoned and fenced actors cannot establish,
expand, rewrite or reactivate it. Shared OS/unrecognized delegates have no universal
mechanical authentication. Ordinary interruption/reconnect needs no repeat Root proof;
authority ends on human revocation, closure or Controller abandonment/replacement.
Goal, scope, acceptance, mode, unfencing or security-baseline changes need an actual
superior human decision. Children cannot authorize them through prompts, state or config.
Controller-direct allows Controller reads/edits/tests/Git and useful auxiliary roles;
single-agent allows ordinary execution without children. A Controller may change
strategy during the same task with `--task-id <id> task-mode --mode <mode>
--human-instruction <actual selection> --base-revision <revision>
--expected-authority-sha256 <hash>`. Authority and revision CAS preserve the goal,
scope and hard constraints. First resolve or explicitly dispose affected managed
dependencies; mode changes do not expand a child's role or readonly permissions.
Default delegated routing,
fresh isolation, readonly restrictions and explicit Astra authorization otherwise hold.

## Task recovery

On CURRENT_CONTINUATION continue or explicitly abandon using the exact task-abandon
packet. Native termination and Controller disposition are different facts.
`--task-id <id> task-dispose-dependency --handoff-id <id> --base-revision <revision>
--expected-lifecycle-sha256 <hash> --reason <actual decision>` abandons that dependency
and fences its managed grants without inventing native terminal evidence. Original
UNKNOWN execution, death proof and writing risk remain UNKNOWN. Isolate or coordinate
possible shared writes before new work; a late result cannot reactivate disposed work.
An unbound dispatch can be disposed through this task-local endpoint. Reused sessions
or ambiguous replaced reservations need an exact native dispatch return ID to bind
new managed work; ordinary reading is not subject to this qualification restriction.
On FOREIGN_RECOVERY_DECISION or UNKNOWN, Controller decides continuation/recovery.
On INVALID_STATE/bootstrap failure diagnose the affected surface; preserve evidence,
label managed assurance UNKNOWN, and route ordinary source work through assigned roles.
For incompatible task schema, read task-status and use task-recover-state with exact
--expected-sha256; ACTIVE recovery also needs --abandon-active and no nonterminal children.
Never delete invalid state or treat it as absent. Runtime drift is evidence for
Controller repair/restore/accepted-upgrade judgment, not a blanket source-work ban.
UNKNOWN missing Host fields, actual authority conflict and role violation are distinct.
Damaged authority blocks only controls, authorization and certification that depend
on it; ordinary diagnostics and independent work may proceed within existing role
boundaries. A new independent task may establish its own authorized current baseline.
Keep raw immutable contracts, user-owned unknown bytes, CAS and historical provenance;
do not silently bless unknown changes or bind ordinary work forever to an old runtime.

Authority conflict recovery uses task-recover-authority --expected-authority-sha256
<exact external hash> --reason <reason>. It archives evidence, restores recorded bytes
and original security baseline, and fences known old children; death proof may stay
UNKNOWN. It cannot bless changed security bytes or remove fences.
User-authorized external repair/forced recovery requires disconnected global integration
and the separate reviewed tools/thaliris_offline_recovery.py runner with exact task,
revision, state/lifecycle hashes and reason. OPERATOR_ASSERTED_USER_DELEGATED_ADMINISTRATION
is operator intent, not cryptographic consent or Host attestation. It archives bytes,
fences extractable identities and releases only the old slot; it grants no task-start,
child binding, Controller identity or readonly exemption. Automated actors are denied
while integration is present. Try native termination/observation of known children;
unknown owner, unbound identities, incompatible fields and unavailable death proof stay
UNKNOWN. Disk disconnection does not prove running Host configuration.

## Host maintenance

Host installation, upgrade and uninstall require a separate --maintenance-contract:
the actual human instruction, exact Host operation/home and independently selected
immutable executor/candidate identities. They require no project init/task admission
and never approve unknown project control instructions. Prior authorized installation
receipts establish Host ownership independently of candidate rendering; unknown bytes
are preserved until exact specific human approval. Preserved role documentation is
manual follow-up, not project admission authority. Disk setup is not native activation.

Host maintenance during another ACTIVE project uses a separate checkout and Codex
session. Only exact identity-checked Host codex-install/codex-uninstall invocations with an explicit --maintenance-contract
cross that boundary; source changes use managed roles. Self-uninstall reports any inert
retained runner for later direct cleanup/reinstall. Changed installation requires a fresh
Host session where needed; disk registration does not prove loaded instruction/catalog
activation. Never change a live task's security anchor as part of source synchronization.
The exact Codex app list_projects/create_thread tools are Controller coordination
for selecting and opening a separately authorized session, not source execution.
This classification does not authorize arbitrary MCP tools, shell work, bound-child
reuse or sending messages to existing chats without human authorization.
An explicit codex-install contract may select exact obsolete global instruction
spans and complete before/after hashes through instruction_migrations; default
installation preserves unmarked user tails. Use the existing maintenance
generation and ownership checks, never a second install into user home.
In user-facing status describe work and concrete blockers plainly; keep receipts,
hashes, attestations and lifecycle details out of that prose and report blocked work honestly.

## Routing, selected context, evidence and acceptance

The Controller is the sole task-specific semantic router. Core records identities,
revisions, hashes, provenance and observations; models decide meaning and completion.
Native Completed proves execution closure, never child-result meaning or quality.
Controller independently interprets the result against human acceptance before
closing the task; SubagentStop is optional observational evidence, not another gate.
Follow the global startup/authority contract and the selected execution mode.
In delegated mode, Controller owns direction, scope, acceptance, context selection
and next routing; assigned executors own implementation design and local methods.
Controller-direct permits Controller execution with useful fresh auxiliary roles;
single-agent permits ordinary execution without children. Isolation and readonly
boundaries hold in every mode. Damaged management does not transfer child duties
to Controller; diagnose the management failure and keep assurance UNKNOWN.

Choose the minimum necessary fresh role for the Workstream's work shape:

| Role | Responsibility | Default native binding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Investigator | Investigator | gpt-6-luna/xhigh |
| Curator | Curator | gpt-6-luna/xhigh |
| Reasoning Specialist | Reasoning specialist | gpt-6.1-sol/high |
| Implementer | Implementer | gpt-6-luna/xhigh |
| Focused Implementer | Focused implementer | gpt-6.1-sol/high |
| Verifier | Verifier | gpt-6-luna/xhigh |
| Reviewer | Reviewer | gpt-6.1-sol/high |

Controller has no fixed model, effort or native profile; Host/user selection applies.
Investigator gathers broad facts, not architecture decisions. Reasoning Specialist
independently challenges a decision basis when that could change direction.
Scanner is a nested Investigator discovery working pattern. Executor is a category
covering Implementer and Focused Implementer; profiles select execution facts for
those same semantic roles. Stable direction and deterministic convergence use
ordinary Implementer; coupled invariants requiring sustained reasoning use Focused
Implementer. Choose one profile per Workstream, not a ladder or size threshold.
Automatic routing stops at Sol; static Astra medium/xhigh profiles require current-task
user authorization before spawn. Per-spawn model/effort overrides are denied.
The dedicated luna-only installation requires `execution_constraint: luna-only`
in the authority contract; it retains semantic roles, restricts ordinary profiles
to Luna/xhigh, and forbids Astra. Children cannot alter the frozen constraint.

## Handoff and operational acceptance

Provide a decision-complete handoff: goal and original acceptance, confirmed facts,
hard invariants and decided boundaries, authoritative source/derived relationships,
affected surfaces, usable verification entry, and decision-changing unknowns.
Include current source locations and covered/uncovered scope from selected discovery.
Resolve ambiguity from the human request and confirmed facts before handoff; bound
the specific discrepancy or transformation in cleanup, migration or synchronization.
Decisions, invariants and acceptance bind; recommendations are non-binding. Methods
belong to the executor. Reuse established inventory and reopen only decision-critical
originals; a new Scanner covers a genuinely uncovered evidence gap.

Use a stable narrative base language and preserve precision-bearing original terms,
quotations, distinctions and user formulations when translation would materially
blur, broaden, narrow or expand meaning. Avoid forced monolingual translation,
random language switching and bilingual repetition. Output language requirements
still govern. Compression and handoff retain this precision-bearing representation.
For operational artifact or installation acceptance, select the authoritative
artifact, source, revision and provenance before delegation, or explicitly assign
that selection to a later Workstream before its operational acceptance.

Project/package install-smoke closure here covers builds, installs, fixtures,
isolated smoke, packed artifacts and project-local verification. Effective live
Host install/upgrade/uninstall, global instructions, profiles, hooks and trust
require separate Host maintenance authority under the global contract.

## Workstream endpoints and review

Controller routes Workstreams; executors close local loops inside them. Semantic dependency,
decision coupling and independent closure define their boundaries. Ordinary Implementer
may finish assigned deterministic execution and Git closure in the same Workstream.
Focused Implementer returns at semantic convergence: core solution/invariants hold,
direction-changing unknowns are resolved, focused evidence supports core semantics,
and remaining work cannot materially change causal model, architecture, contract,
scope, acceptance or direction. A test PASS alone is insufficient. Remaining ordinary
regression, lint/build, sync, deterministic defects, project/package install-smoke checks and Git closure then
go to a fresh ordinary Implementer when assigned; shared guidance cannot extend the
Focused endpoint. FINAL ends a child session; any further work uses a fresh handoff.
Evidence changing a decided boundary or requiring an unverified external capability
returns to Controller; ordinary local defects stay within the accepted assignment.

Classify remaining work as independently deterministic only when the accepted
contract uniquely determines the behavior to preserve. Compatibility authority
ambiguity remains semantic: when production behavior and historical fixtures leave
authority undecided, Focused must supply representative evidence or return the
dependency to Controller; this does not mandate full regression. Controller may
reroute the same semantic closure to a fresh ordinary session when explicit inputs
and independent acceptance suffice and accumulated debugging state adds no benefit.
Carry distilled invariants, exact candidate, green evidence, provenance, remaining
acceptance and blockers, not raw history. FINAL still ends the prior child session.

Select a fresh independent non-writing Reviewer only after candidate convergence
when semantic challenge adds value. It checks original acceptance, invariants and
cross-boundary behavior. Counterevidence is a finding; insufficient evidence remains
unverified. READY requires supported critical closure, not absence of blockers.
Bounded defects with design unchanged go to fresh ordinary correction; changes to
architecture, contract, invariant, scope, acceptance or decision basis reopen Controller.
Before opportunistic work, account for every explicit user goal as addressed,
explicitly deferred, or blocked by a decision-changing dependency.

Fresh role sessions use V2 `fork_turns="none"` or V1 `fork_context=false` to exclude
parent conversation history. Task-specific input is the authorized parent's native
spawn message plus explicitly selected information; applicable global/project AGENTS
and native role instructions still apply. Fresh isolation does not remove these
inherited instructions. Controller may spawn registered
roles; Implementer, Focused Implementer and Reviewer may spawn a fresh Investigator
doing Scanner work. Independent investigation and isolated workstreams may execute
in parallel. Coordinate known overlapping shared-file writes or use separate
worktrees before dispatch; ACTIVE alone does not prove a write conflict. Existing
file CAS catches lost updates, not semantic overlap. Each task permits one unbound
native dispatch until precise identity association; bound siblings may remain live
together. At most one active/pending Scanner belongs to its exact parent. After its
completion or explicit dependency disposition, a fresh Scanner may cover another gap.
Other children cannot delegate. Maximum managed depth is two.
Native capacity does not expand managed authorization; UNKNOWN overlap evidence
does not authorize bypassing Hooks or disabling all future supported delegation.
Keep working sets private; return distilled conclusions, facts, unknowns,
contradictions, verification and optional Artifact pointers. Child communication,
mutation/verification practice and role endpoints are defined in native role prompts.
An active child may receive selected supplemental evidence or factual correction
inside its existing goal and role. Communication cannot alter its authorization.
After FINAL, assign new work to a fresh child.

## Durable retrieval and knowledge admission

Controller alone selects durable retrieval and knowledge admission. Before task-start,
read `.agent-memory/INDEX.md` and `.milestones/INDEX.md`; create minimal thin navigation
if absent. Read selected documents explicitly through catalog/document-get; a bounded
get names up to eight paths. Reread navigation after relevant change, missing context,
invalid freshness or resumed compaction. Near task closure, select Curator only when
reusable knowledge has future value; supply exact prior memory, navigation and evidence.
Keep INDEX semantic and concise. Core validates storage, never chooses relevance.
CHANGED is an observation, not semantic invalidation; Controller decides revalidation.
In default delegated mode, route open discovery, broad searches and large diagnostics
to a short-lived Investigator/Scanner. Controller may read one or very few associated
precise known-path evidence fragments for an immediate decision. Prefer catalog,
document-get, task-get, artifact-get and controller-instructions --section; task-show
is available for explicit diagnosis. Do not assemble a broad investigation through
continuous small queries. Native exec_command precise file reads require a line
slice of at most 200 lines and explicit max_output_tokens of at most 4096; that is
an output-token bound, not a source-byte bound. Prefer the existing bounded retrieval
endpoints. Hooks recognize this small exact-path sliced read shape; they
cannot prove cumulative semantic scope or every third-party MCP tool's behavior.

## Native completion and closure

Use only trusted direct runtime commands and native coordination allowed by the
current execution mode. Native failure reconciliation needs exact trusted evidence;
timeouts, not_found and prose are not death proof. Explicit dependency disposition
may end management without proving termination. Wait only for
a known unfinished necessary child. After FINAL, use its result; a decision-changing
unknown returns the decision to Controller and does not trigger another wait or
repeated recovery of the old task. Choose waiting from the available capability,
expected meaningful event and necessary dependency; prefer native notifications.
The tool maximum is capacity, not a recommended duration. Higher-level duration
limits take precedence; do not impose a universal maximum or fixed wait duration.
Give each necessary dependency one observation owner: executors run and wait on
their own tests/processes/CI and report substantive changes or terminal evidence;
Controller waits for the necessary child result without rechecking the same job.
Do not poll a finished child or create repeated reasoning turns solely to observe
unchanged deterministic state when the runtime can wait for a meaningful or terminal
event. A timeout alone creates no new decision or evidence and does not justify
another status-only reasoning round. Use the native tool family available in the
current session: V1 `wait_agent` returns a status map keyed by the exact spawned
agent ID; V2 `list_agents` returns status entries keyed by canonical task name.
Either can prove native Completed; no V2 switch or second confirmation is required.
The one-key `{"completed": <string or null>}` variant proves execution completion;
null supplies no result text and cannot establish semantic acceptance. A V2 wake-only
wait, Stop, nickname, missing target or unsupported payload remains UNKNOWN.
Conflicting native statuses block new
managed handoffs and closure. SubagentStop is an optional observation; missing or delayed Stop cannot veto proved
native completion. Stop/wake/prose alone is not completion; missing evidence keeps closure UNKNOWN. The last Controller-direct
handoff must complete under the same native evidence rule with no pending/active descendants. Host instruction/catalog
activation remains UNKNOWN without native evidence; changed disk files alone do not
prove activation. Keep security/control-state mutations and live Host installation
outside child source work. See [Codex protocol](../adapter/codex/README.md),
[role profiles](thaliris-role-packs.md), and [task authority](thaliris-task-authority.md).

## Causal diagnosis and acceptance

Reuse the original failure and smallest local reproduction before changing behavior.
Distinguish receive, strict decode, JSON syntax/shape, dispatch, maintenance contract
and runtime identity failures at their actual boundaries. A diagnostic stage is a
failed boundary observation, not proof of the deeper root cause; label guesses as
inferences until source or reproduction supports them. Keep payloads, credentials,
contract contents and unbounded exception objects out of diagnostics.
Repair the supported cause without weakening refusal, identity, ownership, isolation,
native completion or acceptance guarantees for CI. Review READY covers its selected
candidate and criteria; it does not replace final product acceptance. Choose fresh
sessions by remaining independence and total context reconstruction cost, never a
mechanical duration/call threshold or a local PASS alone.
